## Details

---

Las Vegas has things called neighborhood areas which seem to consist of Homeowners and Neighborhood Associations. I could not find any other type of neighborhood related data. There are several large gaps in the map shown [here](https://koordinates.com/layer/97326-las-vegas-nv-neighborhood-areas/). 

You can download neighborhood area shape files [here](https://koordinates.com/layer/97326-las-vegas-nv-neighborhood-areas/download/).  

The data downloaded was taken from [here](https://mapdata.lasvegasnevada.gov/clvgis/rest/services/AdministrativeBoundaries/Parcel_Info/MapServer/2) and was last updated August 27, 2022.
