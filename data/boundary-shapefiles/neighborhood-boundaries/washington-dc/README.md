D.C. has things called neighborhood cluster boundaries which are not actual neighborhood boundaries because D.C doesnâ€™t have actual neighborhood boundaries. It is unclear how they relate to census tracts. They were created in early 2000s and represent a stable set of boundaries that can be used to describe conditions within the District of Columbia over time according to [here](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::neighborhood-clusters/about):

```This data set describes Neighborhood Clusters that have been used for community planning and related purposes in the District of Columbia for many years. It does not represent boundaries of District of Columbia neighborhoods. Cluster boundaries were established in the early 2000s based on the professional judgment of the staff of the Office of Planning as reasonably descriptive units of the City for planning purposes. Once created, these boundaries have been maintained unchanged to facilitate comparisons over time, and have been used by many city agencies and outside analysts for this purpose. ```
