This data is from the Louisville Open GeoSpatial Data website. https://data.lojic.org/datasets/LOJIC::louisville-ky-hud-grant-neighborhoods-from-1979/about

In 2003, the city and county were merged. This map only shows neighborhoods that were part of the city before the merger. I couldn't find a map with neighborhoods for the entire county.
