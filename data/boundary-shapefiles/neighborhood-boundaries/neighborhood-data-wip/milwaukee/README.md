These datasets are from the Milwaukee Open Data website.

I was unable to find any official neighborhoods used by the city. I think they might use Alderman districts for subdivision purposes. https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/aldermanic-districts/resource/e34a8c79-2fad-4c7b-bf46-0ceb210f74fb

There was also a dataset of neighborhoods defined in 2000 using community input. However, it is not used for anything. I have pasted the entire description and disclaimer below. https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/neighborhoods/resource/964353e8-a579-402a-a8e9-c50ea0ae3aa4

Polygons representing City of Milwaukee neighborhoods as defined by the City of Milwaukee Department of City Development (DCD) through the "Milwaukee Neighborhood Identification Project" of 2000 - subdivisions, major streets, physical barriers, community group participation, housing styles, types, & ages, historic areas, and residents' opinions were among the factors used to define boundaries. Note: these boundaries are not intended to define or correspond to boundaries defined by individual neighborhood associations. The neighborhood boundaries identified through this initiative are not used for any official purposes by the City, and are not updated on an ongoing basis. They are not intended to define or correspond to boundaries defined by individual neighborhood organizations.
