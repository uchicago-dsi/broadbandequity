## Details

---

El Paso had data available for the Neighborhood Association Boundaries. These are "organized groups of residents who work together to improve and maintain the quality of life in their neighborhood and community". They are used as neighborhood boundaries by the City of El Paso (per [gis.elpasotexas.gov](gis.elpasotexas.gov)). This dataset could contain holes because there could be areas where people reside that are not officially recognized as "neighborhoods".

I found a version of the data from [here](https://koordinates.com/layer/98659-el-paso-county-texas-subdivisions/) that was uploaded in 2018 from [The City of El Paso GIS](https://gis.elpasotexas.gov/neighborhoodassociations/index.html), but had been converted into shapefile format from ESRI Json format.
