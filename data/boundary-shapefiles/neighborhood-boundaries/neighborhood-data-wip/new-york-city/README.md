## Details

---

NYC has things called NTA's -- neighborhood tabulation areas, which map directly to census tracts, but do not necessarily map directly to neighborhoods. From the site [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/geographic-reference.page):

```Maps of Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs). Neighborhood Tabulation Areas, or NTAs, are aggregations of census tracts that are subsets of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). Primarily due to these constraints, NTA boundaries and their associated names may not definitively represent neighborhoods.```

You can download NTA shape files [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page) however, they do _not_ represent community boards. 

The data downloaded was taken from [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts[year]=0&queries[search]=community) and is the 22A release. There are other releases for different years.
