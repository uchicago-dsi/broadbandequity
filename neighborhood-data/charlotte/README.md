Historic Districts

Seven of Charlotte's most significant older neighborhoods have been designated by City Council as Local Historic Districts, in recognition of their importance in the history and character of the city. The Historic District Commission and its staff work with property owners and businesses in the districts to assure that development and renovation occurs in a manner that is consistent with the character of the neighborhood. The purpose of a local historic district is to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, and conservation of historically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, and objects and their surroundings from potentially adverse influences which may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of important historical, architectural, and archaeological features, which are a part of the cityâ€™s heritage, and to review new construction design to ensure compatibility with the character of the district.
