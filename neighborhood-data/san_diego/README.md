1. Where you found the data

I found the data from San Diego's public website with spatial data. [HERE]: https://sdgis-sandag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SANDAG::community-planning-areas-city/explore?location=33.038091%2C-116.844950%2C9.79

2. Are there any issues that you notice?

There is an area of San Diego city that looks like it is separate from the map. At first I thought it was a hole, but it might be how the city community areas are set up. 

3. Who made the data?  & Are there alternative neighborhood definitions 

The data was made by the city of San Diego. San Diego has 52 Community Planning Areas within the city and 9 districts.
