The downloaded data is called Houston Super Neighborhoods. Check [here](https://cohgis-mycity.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MyCity::super-neighborhoods-1/explore?location=29.765838%2C-95.401954%2C10.90) to download the data. There are some gaps in the map but it's normal. After searching, we find that these gaps are cities/counties that do not belong to Houston but geographically inside Houston.

There are limited sources of Houston data. Another possible choice is TIGER/Line shapefile, 2018. Link [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2018-county-houston-county-tx-all-roads-county-based-shapefile).
