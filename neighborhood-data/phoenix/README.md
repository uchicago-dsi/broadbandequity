This dataset is based on Village data. It divides the city of Phoenix into 15 Urban Villages. Each Village has a Village Planning Committee that is appointed by the City Council. The Village Planning Committees assist the Planning Commission in the performance of its duties. Many neighborhood data sources use the same map.
