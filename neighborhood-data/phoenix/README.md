This dataset is based on estabilished zoning regulations. The source is [here](https://mapping-phoenix.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/Phoenix::zoning/about). The data is the latest (Jan 13, 2022). From the website, it gives a detailed description on this dataset:

```The City of Phoenix (COP) zoning boundaries were digitized from a hard copy data set, by contract, in 1991. Since that time, updates to the data have been made on an ongoing basis as land is rezoned. The layer is digitized at a relatively small scale, from approximately 1:10 to 1:10,000. Changes are made when inconsistencies are found.```

Other than the zoning data, there is another map called "village". It divides the city of Phoenix into 15 Urban Villages. Each Village has a Village Planning Committee that is appointed by the City Council. The Village Planning Committees assist the Planning Commission in the performance of its duties.
