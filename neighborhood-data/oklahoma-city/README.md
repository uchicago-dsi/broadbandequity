Okhlahoma City, Oklahoma had an open data portal where I was able to access both neighborhood association data as well as zip code data. The [portal](https://data.okc.gov/portal/page/start) is run be the City of Oklahoma City

The neighborhood association boundaries represent boundaries for the organized neighborhood associations, considered to be the most accurate boundaries for neighborhoods. This data contains holes for areas that are not official "neighborhoods". The data can be found [here](https://data.okc.gov/portal/page/viewer?datasetName=Neighborhood%20Associations).

The zip code data splits up the cities into zones, but these are not necessarily neighborhoods. I would consider the neighborhood associations to be a more accurate depiction of neighborhoods within the city, but I wanted to include the zip code data here nonetheless. The data can be found [here](https://data.okc.gov/portal/page/viewer?datasetName=Zipcodes&view=map).
