There are very limited resources for geographic data of Philadelphia. The downloaded data is Zoning Base Districts from Department of Planning and Development at Philadelphia. The source is [here](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543864920583086178c4e88/). The data is lastly updated in 01/21/2022. In the website, it gives a detailed description:

```Boundaries of the City of Philadelphia Zoning Base Districts enacted December 15, 2011 and made effective August 22, 2012. Data updates are on-going. Polygon boundaries of Zoning Base Districts based on existing City zoning districts with revised codes applied per enactment of the new Zoning Code of December 2011, made effective August 22, 2012.```

There is another quite old dataset (December 8, 2014). This dataset includes neighborhood boundaries for 157 neighborhoods in Philadelphia. It was created and maintained by Azavea, Inc. The link is [here](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-neighborhoods)

For future efforts in finding more recent data, this [link](https://phl.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) could be a good starting point.
