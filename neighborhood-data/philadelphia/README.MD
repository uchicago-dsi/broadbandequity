There are very limited resources for geographic data of Philadelphia. Here we use a quite old dataset (December 8, 2014). This dataset includes neighborhood boundaries for 157 neighborhoods in Philadelphia. It was created and maintained by Azavea, Inc. The link is [here](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-neighborhoods)

For future efforts in finding more recent data, this [link](https://phl.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) could be a good starting point.
