Nashville had public data available for the Neighborhood Association Boundaries. It represents boundaries for the organized neighborhood associations, but considers this the "current neighborhood boundaries". This data is problematic, however,  because it contains holes for areas that are not "organized neighborhood associations". This data can be found [here](https://data.nashville.gov/Metro-Government/Neighborhood-Association-Boundaries-GIS-/qytv-2cu8).


The data downloaded in this folder was taken from [here](https://data.nashville.gov/Metro-Government/Neighborhood-Association-Boundaries-GIS-/qytv-2cu8). It was developed in 2017. We have both a geojson and a shapefile.
