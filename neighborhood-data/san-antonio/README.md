## Details

---

The downloaded files is from City of San Antonio. The data is called Neighborhood Community and Perimeter Plans Data. This is the [source](https://data.sanantonio.gov/dataset/neighborhood-community-and-perimeter-plans3). Note that there are some holes in the map and the neighborhoods are pretty large.

Another possible source data is Neighborhood Associations Map. Again the map is pretty messy and has a lot of gaps. The link to the data is [here](https://opendata-cosagis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f2b4965f14ab4821a6ebb8bd441b5cea_0/explore?location=29.485179%2C-98.547617%2C10.87).

There is also a third-party source neighbourhood map which can be accessed from [here](https://simplemaps.com/city/san-antonio/neighborhoods). (But need $199 to purchase the geojson and shapefile...)
