1. Where you found the data

I found the data on a geospatial data management website. https://koordinates.com. Since the data is not from official city website, it might not be very representative. 

2. Are there any issues that you notice?

No. I downloaded the council district. There is no information for their neighborhoods. 
 

3. Who made the data?  & Are there alternative neighborhood definitions 

The data was made by Koordinates.
