The downloaded shapefile and geojson file is Los Angeles Neighborhood Map from USC. This is based on LA Times neighborhood map. The data is created and updated in Aug 2017. The link to the source is [here](https://usc.data.socrata.com/dataset/Los-Angeles-Neighborhood-Map/r8qd-yxsr).

Note USLA also has rather similar but not exactly same dataset, which can be accessed through [here](https://apps.gis.ucla.edu/geodata/dataset/los-angeles-county-neighborhoods).

There is also census tract data (2020) for LA county. The link is [here](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::census-tracts-2020/about).
