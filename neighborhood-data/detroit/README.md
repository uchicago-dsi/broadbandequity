## Details

There are two datasets here from the City of Detroit Open Data Portal. Both are published by the city and appear official/used for municipal purposes.

The first is the "Official Master Plan" neighborhoods. There are 54 polygons. The boundaries are clipped to census tracts so there should be no overlaps. https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::master-plan-neighborhoods/about

The second is "Current City of Detroit Neighborhoods" which is described as "Current (non-historic) neighborhood boundaries as compiled by Department of Neighborhoods staff in concert with community groups." This one has 205 polygons. I am not sure if the neighborhoods line up with census tracts. https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::current-city-of-detroit-neighborhoods/about

There is an island, Belle Isle Park, which is in the community neighborhood data but not the official data. However, it appears that no one lives on this island and it only has recreational and entertainment facilities, so I am not sure if it is necessary to include.
