1. Where you found the data

I found the data on Austin city's website: https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?category=Locations+and+Maps&page=1. I plan to use the council districts data. 


2. Are there any issues that you notice?

The data is classified in unusual ways. They have maps for "off-leash areas", "council disctricts", "Health and Human Services location" etc. However nothing classifies their neighborhoods succintly. 

I downloaded the council district data, and I can see that there are holes. *I wonder whether these are areas outside of Austin. 

3. Who made the data?  & Are there alternative neighborhood definitions 

I accessed the data through the City of Austin's open data portal. Austin has over hundred neighborhoods grouped into 9 geographical regions. There wasn't a lot of information about whether the neighborhoods are defined differently in different circumstances.
