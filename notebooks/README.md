This directory contains notebooks for use in the broadband equity project

The notebooks in this directory contains cleaned code that produces deliverable dataframes and visualizations created during Fall 2022. Each deliverable notebook contains information on running the code within it to reproduce the analysis done during the Data Science Clinic Fall of 2022.

The "wip" (work in progress) folder contains code that is not cleaned, but that pertains to progress towards the deliverable form of the code.
