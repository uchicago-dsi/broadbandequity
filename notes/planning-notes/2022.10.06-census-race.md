## Notes on Race Variable

Email from Nicole re: how Race is handled

Just one note on that existing dataset on the portal that Marc mentions. As far as I recall, the output from this data merge needs to be updated as far as how it processes the ACS data on race/Hispanic ethnicity. Many computer scientists are not aware of the conventions for using Census data on race and Hispanic ethnicity. Here are the basics:

* The “race” variable includes black, white, various Asian national origins, and others, but does not include “Hispanic/Latino.”
* There is a separate “Hispanic” variable that indicates whether the respondent is Hispanic/Latino or not (and then some subcategories of different H/L national origins, e.g., Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.
* Given that convention is to report the major “race” groups as white, black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, and other, it is necessary to process and report the data as: “Hispanic (of any race);” “non-Hispanic white,” “non-Hispanic black,” “non-Hispanic Asian,” etc.
* It is also now possible to choose more than one race category, so that could be “non-Hispanic two or more races.”

I believe that the existing dataset on the portal does not separate out “Hispanic” from “non-Hispanic” in the various racial groups as noted in #3. So the students would need to make that change before using that codebase for the clinic project. This was done correctly for the spring clinic project on Chicago.
