### Main Priorities for Week of 1-18-2022 and Beyond

---

#### AWS Data

+ Maia to get the calls ready to pull the data
  + API Calls for Data to get into dataframe and cleaned up from there
  + "Data Profiles" has census tract level for a certain state --> we need to specify which states

#### Census Tract/Neighborhood

+ Overlap Issues - focus on census tract levels for now (ignore this)
+ **Adding Census Tract Level Dataframe (per Nicole's suggestions) - PRIORITIZE**
  + One person to work on
+ Steps:
  + We need a piece of code that gathers census data that we need
  + Match census tracts to other geographies: city boundaries (and/or neighborhood boundaries) - include all census tracts that overlap city at all.
  + Display plots and created standard dataframe
