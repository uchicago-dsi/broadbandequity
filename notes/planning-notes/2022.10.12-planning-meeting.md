Things to do:

* Data Validation: Goal is to feel good about the neighborhood data we downloaded 
    * no overlap
    * no holes
    * coverage of city
* Get internet-access-map code running in docker
    * Does it work? 
* Abstract Chicago-centric data pipeline (already merges FCC/Census data)
    * Read and understand previous code
    * Re-write, where necessary chicago-centric code

* Start thinking about how to compare / contrast cities
    * Do we want to "rank" inequality in cities? 
    * Inequality indexes?

For this week:
[All students] [Evelyn] Find a paper (or 2 or 3) on how to measure inequality 
[Validation Tasks]: THESE ARE HARD.
    [Task #1]: No overlap. Make sure that none of the neighborhoods overlap
    [Wait] [Task #2]: No holes. (Lakes & Rivers) -- maybe this is after census...
    [Task #3]: Coverage of City. Does this cover the entire city?
[Internet-access-map]: Getting it up and running
[Chicago-centric neighborhood code]: Identify code which overlays neighborhoods.
[Reproducing Paper]: What code exists and what does not? Figures 2-5, Table #2 and Table #3
