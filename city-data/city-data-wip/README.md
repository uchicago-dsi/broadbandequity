This folder contains a list of cities for which we were unable to find their shapefile. These cities, along with their respective issues, are listed below: 

- **Austin** (BK)
- **San Francisco** (VK)
  - I was able to find the shapefile for the San Francisco county as well as the San Fran Bay Area, but not for the city itself. Websites that are helpful when reconsidering the boundaries we want to use for SF include:
