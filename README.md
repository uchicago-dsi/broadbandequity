#### Deliverables Spring 2023

This quarter's project involved merging and cleaning the 2013-2017 American Community Survey (ACS) datasets with the CDCâ€™s PLACES dataset by census tracts, creating spatial visualizations of health indicators, and conducting an exploratory analysis report of the observed relationship between broadband connectivity and a constructed health index. The code accompanying the newly merged dataset should be standardized, generalizable, and reproducible.

#### Deliverables Winter 2023

We are looking to build a set of jupyter notebooks to generate maps for the specified metro areas. We are looking to move beyond description and look at association/causal inference analysis. We want to connect our data to sociodemographic factors and use multi-level modeling. We also want to build the pipeline to include data at the neighborhood as well as census tract. This code should be standardized, generalizeable, and reproducible.

#### Deliverables Autumn 2022

We are looking to build a set of jupyter notebooks which generate maps, similar to what was produced last year, for the specified metro areas to demonstrate the extent of internet equity. These notebooks should rely on a standardized set of libraries (to also be written) which avoid code repetition as well as use docker for code reproducibility purposes.

#### Goals

+ Fetch and combine City, Census, and FCC data sources relevant to internet access in Chicago
+ Produce descriptive analysis and visualizations of state of access across the city
+ Enable continued work with datasets via reusuable functions

---

#### Docker

There is a dockerfile in the repo. To build the file, build the repository using the command:

```docker build . -t broadband --platform=linux/amd64```

Once the docker file is built, you can run the following command in order to run your jupyter notebook. This will also mount the current directory inside the container.

```docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/tmp broadband```

Once this is running you should be able to access the notebook by going to your web browser and going to 

```http://127.0.0.1:8888/```

If you need to add a package via pip, use the file ```requirements.txt``` which has a basic set of packages installed. Add the package and version and then rebuild the container in order to add it.

If you want to run an interactive terminal, you can run the following command. Note that running an interactive terminal is required to run the data generation for the internet access map (the national map).

```docker run  --platform=linux/amd64 -it -v ${PWD}:/tmp broadband /bin/bash```

For example, if you want to generate the internet access data, do the following:

  * Start an interactive terminal using the docker run command above
  * Go to the internet-access-map directory (```cd internet-access-map```)
  * Run get_data (```./get_data.sh```)
  * Run merge_data (```./merge_data.sh```)

This will create the merged dataset

#### Usage
Once installed, access modules from the main directory via relative imports - for example, `from data_pipeline import fetch_census_data`. If working in a subdirectory, modify `sys.path` to enable imports, such as with `sys.path[0] = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(''),'..')`. (For examples, see first code cells in analysis notebooks.)

#### Data

This folder contains the raw and processed data used in our analysis. More information is included in the data folder. It contains the following sets of data:
+ [acs_data](data/acs_data): Pulled ACS 5-year estimate data and columns of interest for 2017 and 2021 5 yr estimates
+ [archived_chicago_data](data/archived_chicago_data): Archived Chicago data from before the data science clinic projects
+ [boundary-shapefiles](data/boundary-shapefiles): SHP files for cities of interest. This includes city boundary data and census tract dataframes
+ [standard_dataframes](data/standard_dataframes): Standard dataframes produced for analysis. These dataframes combine neighorhood, census tract, and ACS dataframes for all cities into a single dataframe
+ [TIGER-census-data](data/TIGER-census-data): State-based TIGER shapefiles for states for both 2017 and 2021.


---

#### Lib
